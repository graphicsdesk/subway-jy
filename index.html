  Gov. Kathy Hochul announced her plans to extend the Second Avenue subway line, served primarily by the Q train, to Central Harlem and Manhattanville on Jan. 9 during her annual State of the State address. More than two weeks after the announcement, Community Board 9 has yet to hear from the MTA or the governor’s office regarding the plans.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  During the address, Hochul described her plans to extend the Q train westward to have three new stops: Lenox Avenue, St. Nicholas Avenue, and Broadway. Upon completion, the line could serve 240,000 passengers daily and reduce congestion around the buses on 125th Street, where over 30,000 people ride the bus daily, according to the governor’s office.

            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  When the 1, 2, and 3 trains between 42nd and 137th Street to 96th Street were <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/city-news/2024/01/04/1-2-and-3-service-suspended-following-subway-train-derailment-near-96th-street/">suspended</a> earlier this month, West Harlem—a neighborhood only accessible by the 1, 2, and 3 trains Broadway lines—was uniquely affected.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Victor Edwards, chair of CB9, said that he found out about the extension plan on the news and has not received communication regarding the plans from the governor’s office. Edwards said he has refrained from releasing a statement from CB9 without having access to more information.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “I know people in that area, it could definitely be helpful for them going and coming, and maybe some West Harlem residents that take the bus across town here and then go down, it can be easy for crossing over later further downtown,” Edwards said. “But I really have to find out more about it to make a full statement.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The governor’s office told Spectator that the proposal to extend the Q train to 125th Street and Broadway is in its early stages and the planning of the extension will include engaging with the West Harlem community.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  This westward extension proposal comes at a time when the second phase of the Second Avenue subway extension—extending to East 125th Street in Harlem—is set to begin. The extension received federal environmental approval in 2018. On Monday, Hochul awarded $182 million, the first construction contract, to C.A.C. Industries, a New York City-based civil contractor. The entire project, which officials expect to be completed by the early 2030s, will cost $6.9 billion. Hochul intends to have both the westward and eastward extension occur simultaneously to reduce costs to the MTA.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “By continuing the tunnel boring machine’s westward path beyond the Phase Two work, the MTA may be able to incur substantial time and cost savings, estimated at over $400 million, relative to performing that work at a later date,” Hochul wrote in her 2024 State of the State proposal.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The MTA declined to comment on the governor’s new proposal.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Barry Weinberg, first vice chair of CB9, said that while he thinks the extension would be helpful for many West Harlem residents, he is skeptical the extension will actually happen.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “I don’t know that we are getting the expansion,” Weinberg said. “Many people have proposed a line like this for many years. So, I would heavily caveat that with this sort of ‘I’ll believe it when I see it.’”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  In her proposal, Hochul wrote the project scored well on the MTA’s 20- Year Needs Assessment. Before undergoing environmental review and preliminary engineering, the MTA will conduct a feasibility study, evaluating the alignment options, service requirements and impacts, and how to make the construction cost-efficient.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Hochul added in her proposal that adding more stops along the “commercial corridor” of 125th Street would improve accessibility to east side job centers and improve other connections between “key employment, education, and cultural centers, such as Columbia University’s Manhattanville campus.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “We applaud the Governor’s vision for expansion of the Second Avenue Subway and will support efforts by the state and city to expand transportation opportunities for all who live and work in upper Manhattan,” a University spokesperson wrote in a statement to Spectator.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  When asked if the reason the Second Avenue subway extension is finally occurring is because of the recent opening of the Manhattanville campus, Weinberg said that he thought that the Manhattanville campus is a “convenient part of the narrative for the governor.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “I don’t think it would be a decision-making piece of it, per se,” Weinberg said. “There are a number of reasons that the 125th Street makes sense between both Columbia’s new campus but also the existing density of residential and the Manhattanville factory district that’s on Amsterdam.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The Second Avenue extension is a part of Hochul’s plan to “Building Our Transportation Future,” a dedicated section in her State of the State proposal. Alongside the westward extension, Hochul also has plans to move forward with the interborough express and building a solar carport near the John F. Kennedy Airport.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Even though CB9 is yet to hear from the governor’s office, Edwards said that any extension of transportation is good for the city.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “Most people around the city, we’re moving away from carbon-producing alternatives. So it’s a good thing,” Edwards said. “I don’t want to see us go backwards to go forward, so to speak, but I haven’t seen any plans on that. No one’s reached out to us so far.”
